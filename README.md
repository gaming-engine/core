# Gaming Engine

Have you ever wanted to make your own Browser-Based game? Have you started the process, only to find out how expensive
developers are to build features for your site that are required but not special for your game? Read more about Gaming
Engine [here](https://gamingengine.dev).

# Gaming Engine - Core Features

This is the core functionality of the Gaming Engine which will be used by all browser based games. It is thin by design,
allowing you to have the bare minimum functionality required to run the site.

This will include, and not be limited to:

* User Accounts
* Roles and Permissions
* Administration Panel
* Maintain Packages

## Testing

Making sure that the framework is working as anticipated is one of our main focuses. Because of this, we will do our
best to make sure that the code is of the best quality possible. Because of that, the commitment to you, the user of it
will be 95% test coverage of any features that are built into it (for all parts of the framework and not just this
component). We will run all tests on MySQL, PostgresSQL and SQLite databases to ensure maximum flexibility.

To run tests, you can run the following command:

```bash
composer test
```
